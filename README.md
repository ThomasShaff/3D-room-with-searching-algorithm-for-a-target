# 3D-room-with-searching-algorithm-for-a-target
Object-oriented programming to create a 3-dimensional room and a drone and its controls. Then an algorithm to navigate the entire room and detect a target within a given radius. The code is not yet optimized because I had several ideas to implement it and some ideas were therefore abandoned but are still present (notably some unused functions).
