# 3D-room-with-searching-algorithm-for-a-target
Object-oriented programming to create a 3-dimensional room and a drone and its controls. Then an algorithm to navigate the entire room and detect a target within a given radius. The code is not yet optimized because I had several ideas to implement it and some ideas were therefore abandoned but are still present (notably some unused functions).


They are three main codes, using the same classes everytime but with a few differences :

1- The first one is using while loop

2- The second one is using for loop (a little bit faster)

3- The last one is completely different because it also contains a display using matplotlib.pyplot
